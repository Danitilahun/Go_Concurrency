# Explanation of Inconsistent Results in Go Code with Atomic Operations

The provided Go code illustrates a concurrent calculator implementation using the `atomic` package for atomic operations on a shared variable (`calculator.res`). The code launches multiple goroutines to perform arithmetic operations concurrently on the shared resource.

## Reason for Inconsistent Results

1. **Concurrency without Synchronization**:

   - Although atomic operations from the `atomic` package are used, the code lacks synchronization between goroutines.
   - Multiple goroutines concurrently access and modify the `calculator.res` variable without synchronization, leading to a data race condition.

2. **Non-Deterministic Behavior**:

   - Due to concurrent access and updates without synchronization, the sequence and timing of operations become non-deterministic.
   - The lack of synchronization causes the order of execution and interleaving of operations to vary between runs.

3. **Data Race Consequence**:
   - The shared resource (`calculator.res`) is concurrently accessed by multiple goroutines performing add, subtract, multiply, and divide operations.
   - The non-synchronized access to the shared resource results in inconsistent final values due to concurrent modifications.

## Solution

To resolve the inconsistency and ensure deterministic behavior:

- Use synchronization mechanisms like mutexes (`sync.Mutex`) or other synchronization methods from the `sync` package to protect access to the shared resource (`calculator.res`).
- Implement proper locking and unlocking to ensure that only one goroutine accesses the shared resource at a time, preventing data races and ensuring consistent outcomes.

## Conclusion

The observed inconsistency in results is due to concurrent operations without proper synchronization. Addressing this by implementing synchronization mechanisms will ensure consistent and deterministic behavior in concurrent programs.
