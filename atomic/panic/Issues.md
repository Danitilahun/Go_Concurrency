# Explanation of Issues with `atomic.Value` in Go

In the provided code snippet utilizing `atomic.Value` from the `sync/atomic` package, two issues arise when attempting to store values:

## 1. Cannot Store `nil`:

Attempting to store a `nil` value (`v.Store(nil)`) using `atomic.Value` results in a panic. The `atomic.Value` type in Go does not permit storing a `nil` value directly. It requires a non-`nil` initial value to be stored during initialization or subsequent operations.

## 2. Inconsistent Types:

The code tries to store values of different types (`v.Store(1)` followed by `v.Store("1")`), leading to a panic. The `atomic.Value` expects consistent types for stored values. Storing values of different types violates this requirement and causes a panic indicating that the types must be consistent.

### Issues Explained:

- `atomic.Value` in Go allows atomic access to a single value of a specific type.
- It necessitates an initial value of a specific type to be stored during initialization (`Store` operation) and requires subsequent stored values to be of the same type.
- Storing `nil` or values of different types than the initial stored type violates these constraints, leading to panics due to inconsistency or invalid operations on `atomic.Value`.
