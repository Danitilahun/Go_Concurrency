# Explanation of Benchmark Functions

The provided benchmark functions `BenchmarkStoreInt64` and `BenchmarkStoreValue` compare the effectiveness of storing `int64` values using different synchronization mechanisms: `atomic.StoreInt64` and `atomic.Value`.

## BenchmarkStoreInt64:

- **Usage**:
  - Utilizes `atomic.StoreInt64` to atomically store integers into an `int64` variable.
  - Employs `sync.WaitGroup` to coordinate goroutines, performing `b.N` iterations with each iteration storing an `int64` value atomically.

## BenchmarkStoreValue:

- **Usage**:
  - Utilizes `atomic.Value` to store `int64` values using `v.Store(int64(i))` in concurrent goroutines.
  - Simulates a scenario where `atomic.Value` holds and stores `int64` values without explicit type conversions during loading, which are often necessary in real-world scenarios.

## Effectiveness and Explanation:

- **BenchmarkStoreInt64**:

  - More effective due to:
    - Direct use of `atomic.StoreInt64` for atomic operations on `int64`.
    - Avoids type conversion overhead and operates directly on a known type (`int64`).

- **BenchmarkStoreValue**:
  - Represents a scenario with `atomic.Value` but without the need for type assertions during loads.
  - Less reflective of real-world scenarios where type conversions may be necessary for non-trivial types, potentially impacting performance.

## Conclusion:

- For atomic operations involving known types (like `int64`), using dedicated atomic functions like `atomic.StoreInt64` from `sync/atomic` generally outperforms `atomic.Value`.
- `atomic.Value` is advantageous for handling arbitrary or unknown types but might introduce overhead due to type assertion during value loads, affecting performance compared to direct atomic functions.
