# Functionalities of the Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) in a CPU

The Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) is a fundamental component of a CPU responsible for performing arithmetic and logical operations on data according to instructions received from the Control Unit (CU). The ALU consists of various functionalities:

## Arithmetic Operations

- **Addition:** Adds two numbers together to produce a sum.
- **Subtraction:** Subtracts one number from another to produce a difference.
- **Multiplication:** Multiplies two numbers to produce a product.
- **Division:** Divides one number by another to produce a quotient and possibly a remainder.
- **Increment/Decrement:** Increases or decreases the value of a number by one.

## Logical Operations

- **AND Operation:** Performs a logical AND operation on binary inputs, producing an output based on logical conjunction.
- **OR Operation:** Performs a logical OR operation on binary inputs, producing an output based on logical disjunction.
- **NOT Operation:** Performs a logical NOT operation on a single binary input, producing the logical negation of the input.
- **XOR (Exclusive OR) Operation:** Performs a logical XOR operation on binary inputs, producing an output that is true only if the inputs differ.

## Comparison Operations

- **Equality Comparison:** Compares two values to determine if they are equal.
- **Inequality Comparison:** Compares two values to determine if they are not equal.
- **Greater Than Comparison:** Compares two values to determine if one is greater than the other.
- **Less Than Comparison:** Compares two values to determine if one is less than the other.

## Shift and Rotate Operations

- **Shift Left/Right:** Moves the bits of a binary number left or right by a specified number of positions.
- **Rotate Left/Right:** Moves the bits of a binary number left or right, shifting in the shifted-out bits.

## Bitwise Operations

- **Bitwise AND:** Performs a bitwise AND operation on corresponding bits of two binary numbers.
- **Bitwise OR:** Performs a bitwise OR operation on corresponding bits of two binary numbers.
- **Bitwise NOT:** Performs a bitwise NOT operation on all bits of a binary number, inverting them.

The ALU's primary function is to execute these arithmetic, logical, comparison, and bit manipulation operations based on instructions, contributing significantly to the CPU's computation capabilities.
